## Introduction 

The core mission of Lamas Finance is to provide users with a real blockchain gaming experience and the opportunity to make a profit from many DeFi’s key functions.  

Developed on Solana - one of the fastest and cheapest platforms in the cryptocurrency space, each of the Lamas Finance games is a genuine Dapp: all computations are performed on the blockchain via smart contracts. Our platform offers a number of functions, including games, NFT collections, and yield farming. LMF, the native utility token of Lamas, is utilized for a multitude of reasons, including game participation, NFT exchange, staking, and yield farming.  

Currently, Lamas Finance provides its players four games: Price Prediction, Up or Down, Jackpot Lottery, and Lucky Spinner. The first two are guessing games involving the price of an asset, with payouts proportionate to the players' forecasting accuracy. While Price Prediction requires players to provide an exact figure, Up or Down enables users to wager on market movements in one of the two directions. The other two games are dependent on luck. In Jackpot Lottery, users have a daily chance to win a jackpot if their tickets match the randomly drawn numbers. In Lucky Spinner, users can win multiples of their stake through random spins at any time of their choosing. More information is provided in Games. 

**Along with LMF tokens, participants in the games may acquire NFT pieces. Fantastic prizes are awarded to users for completing the NFT collections. In order to accelerate their progress, users may trade NFT on the Lamas Marketplace.**

There are 4 NFT collections, one for each game. Each collection is represented by a single picture that has been divided into 6 different pieces. Each piece is available in 3 different versions corresponding to rarity ratings of 1, 2, or 3 stars (an NFT piece with 3 stars is uncommon). Currently, there are a total of 72 different NFT pieces: 4 (games) x 6 (pieces/game) x 3 (versions/piece).

Each week, we will choose a “theme-of-the-week collection” (theme) at random. Players who own a full collection (6 different NFT pieces of the same collection and of the same rarity) of the theme will have the choice to redeem it for a valuable reward.

LMF token holders can participate in staking on the Lamas Finance platform with a high APY. In doing so, users can earn interest and avoid paying up to 50% of gaming taxes with the addition of being granted governance rights. Furthermore, they can make additional revenue through yield farming.
